# Acoustic Localization and Tracking via Machine Learning
MEng Design project code.

Abstract:
For our project, our goal is to track users in a room using an array of microphones. To do this,
we first model a room with echoes, and we populate this room with users and microphones. We
extract information from this modelled room to create a so-called channel state information (CSI)
matrix. Depending on the application, we use a supervised or an unsupervised deep learning
model to learn the channel from the CSI matrix. If the goal is to predict user locations in cartesian
space, we use the supervised model. If we want to learn the channel itself, we use the unsupervised
model. Though a lot of research in localization has been done in RF communication, we use acoustic
communication to further understand its merits, its workings, and its negatives to hopefully expand
a field in ECE.
